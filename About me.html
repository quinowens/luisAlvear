        <h2>A brief intro...</h2>
        <p>
            I am a junior undergraduate Computer Science student at Purdue University Northwest, however, I am not from
            The United States. Let's start from the beginning... I was born in December 2001 in Santander, a small city
            in
            the
            north
            of Spain. While growing up I always had a passion for computers and all kinds of technology. I would always
            go
            out in my free time with my friends to take some videos and edit them when getting back home. I was spending
            lots of time creating short movies, jailbreaking my Ipad, and playing around with computers in general.
            Throughout
            my
            childhood I practiced some peculiar sports such as judo, polo, snowboarding, and motocross. I was never a
            big fan of soccer, which is such a popular sport in Spain.<br>

            <br>
            I started playing tennis at a young age at the country club in my city. I used to practice for five or six
            hours
            during
            the week and I played some tournaments over the weekend, nothing special. By that time, I didn't know that
            tennis was going to have such an impact on my life. When I was 15 years old I decided to go to a boarding
            school, where I was going to be able to play tennis and combine my studies at the same time.
            It was a tough decision since I was still a young teenager and I had to move to another city without my
            parents to
            start a completely new life alone. I got a lot into math when I was 16 years old. I already
            knew that I wanted to pursue a major in Computer Science in college so I decided to take a high-school math
            course in sorting algorithms, where I was able to hand-trace lots of algorithms that I am using nowadays,
            such as binary search,
            insertion sort, quick sort, etc... .<br>

            <br>
            I turned 17, the time to go to college was around the corner. I committed to McKendree University, where I
            received a scholarship for playing in the Men's Tennis team. I have lots of memories from the first day of
            my coding class, which was C++. I didn't have previous coding experience so I struggled a little the first
            couple of weeks. Nowadays, I have a passion for Software Engineering. Writing software in powerful
            programming languages such as C++ or Java is what I tend to do in my free time. I like solving coding
            challenges, where I can try and prove my programming skills. My favorite one is the Avent of Code.
            Currently, I am working on two Projects but you will find that information on my <a href="Skills.html">
                work experience and skills </a> site.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <h4>Rafa Nadal Academy: 2017-2019</h4>

            <p>Rafa Nadal Academy is a high-performance tennis academy located on the island of Mallorca, Spain. I had
                the
                chance to complete my 11th and 12th grade of high school and play a lot of tennis the two years I spent
                here.<br> <br>Clearly
                it was a difficult time for me at the beginning. Since it is a boarding school located on an island, it
                was hard for me to visit my family. For the first couple of months, I was 15, sometimes it was hard for
                me to not feel lonely but being at this place was the key for me to decide on coming to the United
                States later on.
                On the other side, I met a lot of people from all around the world and I made new valuable friends that
                I
                know that will be there for me for the rest of my life. <br><br>Being at Rafa Nadal Academy helped me
                build-up
                important life values, especially discipline. I've couldn't have played two hours a day of tennis early
                in
                the morning and go to school in the afternoon without discipline. When I was in my 12th grade I took
                the
                SAT, to start looking for a university in the United States. I was able to commit to McKendree
                University. By the time I graduated, I was 17 years old and I was ready to start a new college
                experience in the United States, however, I will always remember the two years I spent at Rafa Nadal
                Academy as the best years of my life.</p>

    <div class="McKendree">
        <h4>McKendree University: 2019-2021</h4>
        <p>McKendree University is a private university located in Lebanon, a town about 15 minutes away from St.
            Louis, Missouri. It
            was here where I had my first college life experience. <br> <br>I have a lot of good memories from this
            place.
            My teammates became my second family and we went through a lot of difficult moments together like practicing
            at 5:30 AM. We also traveled together around the country almost every weekend when we were on our tennis
            season to compete against other schools, which was an experience I won't ever forget. From an
            academic standpoint, I had a good performance throughout the two years I spent at McKendree even though my
            programming skills weren't the best at the beginning, I worked hard to get outstanding grades in all of my
            courses, ending up with a cumulative GPA of 3.869. I learned a lot about objected-programming languages,
            especially C++, which is today, my favorite programming language.<br><br></p>

            <p>Purdue University Northwest is a public university that takes part of the Purdue University system
                located in
                Hammond,
                Indiana, about 25 minutes away from downtown Chicago. I transferred to this school in the junior year of
                my
                undergraduate degree. Choosing Purdue University Northwest to finish my Bachelor's degree has been such
                a
                great decision. <br> <br>Purdue University's programs in engineering and sciences have been ranked among
                the best in the country and being part of it makes me feel proud. At the same time, I
                continue playing tennis on the Men's Tennis team, which is a crucial point for me to achieve my best
                academic performance.
                <br><br>
                My passion for programming made me join the Computer Science Club at the school, which is a club
                composed of
                Computer Science majors dedicated to improving programming skills through project collaboration and
                group
                study sessions. We are currently developing different projects and we will be participating in
                Hackathons next semester, which will be very helpful for me and my future career. <br><br>

            <p> Code For Good is a hackathon organized by JPMorgan Chase where university students from 
                all over the world
                are invited to use their skills to help a nonprofit organization further their mission.
                <br> 
                Students are given 24 hours to develop a solution to the problem presented by the 
                organizations. 
                My team and I were tasked with building a learning management system
                to help Refined and Refreshed Inc. break the cycle of generational poverty. We were in a team of 5 students
                and over the 24 hours, we developed a web application that would allow the organization to track the progress 
                of their students and provide them with the resources they need to succeed.
                It was an amazing experience and I am so grateful to have been a part of it. I got to work in a team 
                of likeminded individuals, all with different skillsets and backgrounds, and we were assisted by mentors
                from JPMorgan Chase. I learned a lot about teamwork and how to work in a fast-paced environment. 
                By the end of the event, we were able to code up a final product and get to see our work deployed into the real world.
